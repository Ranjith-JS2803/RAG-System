What is virtual memory?,"virtual memory, physical memory, logical memory, paging","Virtual memory is a memory management technique that provides an abstraction of physical memory, allowing the execution of processes larger than physical memory by using disk storage and techniques like paging or segmentation."
How does an OS handle deadlocks?,"deadlocks, prevention, avoidance, detection, recovery",An OS handles deadlocks through various strategies: 1. Prevention by eliminating one of the necessary conditions. 2. Avoidance by dynamically analyzing resource allocation. 3. Detection by monitoring resource allocation graphs. 4. Recovery by preempting resources or terminating processes.
Describe RAID levels and their benefits.,"RAID, redundancy, performance, striping, mirroring, parity","RAID levels offer various benefits: RAID 0 (striping) increases performance, RAID 1 (mirroring) enhances reliability, and RAID 5 (parity) provides both redundancy and performance. Each level balances trade-offs between speed, fault tolerance, and storage efficiency."
What is context switching?,"context switching, process control block, CPU scheduling","Context switching occurs when the CPU switches from one process to another. It involves saving the current process's state in its PCB and loading the next process's state, ensuring smooth multitasking."
Explain the concept of multi-threading.,"multi-threading, concurrency, thread management, performance","Multi-threading allows a process to have multiple threads executing concurrently, improving application performance and resource utilization by sharing process resources among threads."
What is a system call?,"system call, user mode, kernel mode, interface","A system call is an interface for programs to request services from the operating system kernel, such as file operations, process control, and communication."
What are the differences between paging and segmentation?,"paging, segmentation, memory management, logical address","Paging divides memory into fixed-size blocks, while segmentation divides it into variable-sized segments. Paging focuses on efficient memory allocation, whereas segmentation aligns with logical program structures."
How does the OS ensure file system security?,"file system security, access control, encryption","An OS ensures file system security through mechanisms like access control lists (ACLs), encryption, and user authentication, protecting data from unauthorized access."
Explain I/O scheduling and its types.,"I/O scheduling, FCFS, SSTF, disk scheduling algorithms","I/O scheduling optimizes the order of disk access requests to improve performance. Common algorithms include FCFS (First-Come-First-Serve), SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), and more advanced ones like SCAN and C-SCAN."
What is the purpose of a process scheduler?,"process scheduler, CPU scheduling, priorities, time sharing","A process scheduler manages process execution by allocating CPU time based on scheduling policies. It ensures fair resource sharing, prioritization, and system responsiveness."
How does Linux manage processes?,"Linux, process management, fork, exec, signals","Linux manages processes through system calls like fork (to create a new process), exec (to replace process memory), and signals (to communicate between processes)."
What are the different states of a process?,"process states, ready, running, waiting, terminated","A process transitions through several states: New (being created), Ready (waiting to execute), Running (executing instructions), Waiting (waiting for resources), and Terminated (completed execution)."
What is the difference between preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling?,"preemptive scheduling, non-preemptive scheduling, CPU scheduling","Preemptive scheduling allows the OS to interrupt a running process to allocate the CPU to another process, whereas non-preemptive scheduling requires the process to relinquish the CPU voluntarily."
What is the role of a memory manager?,"memory manager, allocation, deallocation, fragmentation",A memory manager handles the allocation and deallocation of memory space for processes. It minimizes fragmentation and ensures efficient utilization of memory resources.
Explain the concept of spooling.,"spooling, buffer, device management, printing","Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations On-Line) is a technique that uses a buffer to hold data for devices, like printers, enabling efficient operation by queuing tasks for sequential execution."
